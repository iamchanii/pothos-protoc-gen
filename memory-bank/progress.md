# Progress: pothos-protoc-gen

## Current Status
The project is in a functional state as a protoc plugin that generates Pothos GraphQL schema code from Protocol Buffer definitions. We are currently in the documentation and exploration phase to understand the codebase better.

## What Works
- Core plugin functionality for generating TypeScript code from protobuf definitions
- Mapping of protobuf messages to GraphQL object types
- Mapping of protobuf enums to GraphQL enum types
- Mapping of protobuf services to GraphQL queries and mutations
- Support for well-known type wrappers
- Custom scalar mappings
- Type registry generation

## What's Left to Build
- Comprehensive test suite
- Additional documentation
- Potential enhancements based on user feedback
- Performance optimizations

## Implementation Progress

### Core Features
- ✅ Plugin initialization and option parsing
- ✅ Protobuf schema traversal and collection
- ✅ TypeScript code generation
- ✅ Pothos GraphQL schema integration
- ✅ Service method mapping to queries and mutations

### Type Mapping
- ✅ Basic scalar types
- ✅ Message types
- ✅ Enum types
- ✅ Well-known type wrappers
- ✅ Map entry types
- ✅ Nested message types

### Code Generation
- ✅ File artifact generation
- ✅ Global scalar map entries
- ✅ Pothos type registry
- ✅ Input type constructors
- ✅ Object type references
- ✅ Context interface

### Plugin Options
- ✅ Query method specification
- ✅ Mutation method specification
- ✅ Service inclusion filtering

## Known Issues
- No comprehensive test suite identified yet
- Documentation is minimal
- Potential edge cases with complex nested types

## Next Development Priorities
1. Explore the codebase in more detail
2. Identify areas for improvement or enhancement
3. Consider adding tests if they don't exist
4. Improve documentation for users

## Recent Achievements
- Created comprehensive memory bank documentation
- Established a clear understanding of the project architecture and purpose
