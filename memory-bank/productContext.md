# Product Context: pothos-protoc-gen

## Problem Statement
Developers working with both Protocol Buffers and GraphQL face several challenges:
1. Maintaining separate definitions for the same data models in both protobuf and GraphQL
2. Ensuring consistency between gRPC services and GraphQL resolvers
3. Manually translating between protobuf types and GraphQL types
4. Keeping the GraphQL schema in sync with changes to protobuf definitions

## Solution
pothos-protoc-gen solves these problems by:
- Automatically generating GraphQL schema code from protobuf definitions
- Using Pothos, a code-first GraphQL schema builder for TypeScript
- Providing a single source of truth in the protobuf files
- Enabling seamless updates when protobuf definitions change

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Developers should be able to use the plugin with minimal configuration
- **Transparency**: The generated code should be readable and maintainable
- **Flexibility**: The plugin should support customization options for specific use cases
- **Reliability**: The generated GraphQL schema should accurately reflect the protobuf definitions

## Integration Context
pothos-protoc-gen is designed to work within a development workflow that includes:
- Protocol Buffer definitions (.proto files)
- The protoc compiler with TypeScript support
- Pothos GraphQL schema builder
- A TypeScript-based GraphQL server (like Apollo Server, Express GraphQL, etc.)

## Workflow
1. Developers define their data models and services in .proto files
2. The protoc compiler runs with pothos-protoc-gen as a plugin
3. TypeScript code is generated for the Pothos GraphQL schema
4. Developers import and use the generated code in their GraphQL server

## Value Proposition
By using pothos-protoc-gen, developers can:
- Reduce duplication of effort in maintaining separate schema definitions
- Ensure consistency between different API interfaces
- Focus on business logic rather than schema translation
- Leverage the type safety of both Protocol Buffers and TypeScript
