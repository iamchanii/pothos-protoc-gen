# Active Context: pothos-protoc-gen

## Current Focus
The project is currently in the initial setup and documentation phase. We are establishing a memory bank to track the project's context, architecture, and progress.

## Recent Changes
- Created the memory bank structure with core documentation files
- Documented the project's purpose, architecture, and technical context

## Active Decisions
- **Documentation Structure**: Established a comprehensive memory bank to track all aspects of the project
- **Project Understanding**: Building a clear understanding of the codebase and its architecture
- **Development Approach**: Preparing for potential enhancements or bug fixes by documenting the current state

## Current Considerations
- **Code Organization**: The project follows a modular structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Plugin Architecture**: The system is designed as a protoc plugin that generates TypeScript code
- **Type Mapping**: Special attention is given to mapping between Protocol Buffer types and GraphQL types
- **Service Integration**: The plugin supports mapping services to GraphQL queries and mutations

## Next Steps
1. **Codebase Exploration**: Further explore the codebase to understand implementation details
2. **Feature Analysis**: Identify potential areas for enhancement or improvement
3. **Testing Strategy**: Develop a strategy for testing the plugin's functionality
4. **Documentation Refinement**: Continue to refine and expand the documentation as we learn more

## Open Questions
- How are complex Protocol Buffer types handled in the GraphQL schema?
- What is the current test coverage for the plugin?
- Are there any known limitations or edge cases in the current implementation?
- What are the most common use cases and integration patterns for this plugin?

## Current Challenges
- Understanding the complete transformation pipeline from Protocol Buffers to GraphQL
- Identifying potential areas for optimization or enhancement
- Ensuring compatibility with different versions of Protocol Buffers and Pothos GraphQL
